Introducing RevelsMD
===================================

RevelsMD (REduced Variance Estimators of the Local Strucure in MD simulations) is a python package which allows for the calculatation of reduced variance radial distribution and 3 dimensional densities using a family of force sampling methods. The code can process a variety of different software outputs (lammps, vasp, mdanalaysis) as well as being able to be interfaced with directly using trajectory information loaded into numpy arrays.

RevelsMD was developed over 5 years at Sorbonne Universit√© and the University of Bath. This code is the culmination of many years of statistical mechanical and computational chemical development. A small history of this is provided in the :doc:`history` section,as well as in `this 2020 review <https://pubs.aip.org/aip/jcp/article/153/15/150902/315648>`_ 

Check out the :doc:`usage` section for further information, including
how to :ref:`installation` the project.
