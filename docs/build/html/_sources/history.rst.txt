History of force sampling methods
=====

RevelsMD is the first pubicly available code to employ the famlily of force sampling methods which date back to the intitial paper of Borgis in 2012, this initial paper outlined the methodology by which force sampling can be used to calculate 3D densities and radial distribution functions. This work lay dormant for a time, before the publication of additional work looking at expanding the method to polarisation densities and constrained molecules; ion mobilities in nanoslits; and by the employment of linear combinations.

A full descritpion of the history of the field can be found in `this 2020 review <https://pubs.aip.org/aip/jcp/article/153/15/150902/315648>`_  which also details the parralel developments by scientists working in Buffalo and Bayreuth, who's work provides ciritcal support to the work performed in Paris.
