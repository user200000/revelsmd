## RevelsMD
RevelsMD is a code for force based estimation of equilibrium structural features from atomistic simulations, with greatly reduced variance

The code can calculate both three-dimensional solvent densities for NVT simulations, and radial distribution functions. The code can parse Gromacs, Lammps and Vasp inputs as well as being directly interfaced with via numpy arrays.
